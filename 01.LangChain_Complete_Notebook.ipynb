It is both a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and also loosely based on the real-life Boston Winter Hill Gang; the character Colin Sullivan is based on the corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while the character Frank Costello is based on Irish-American gangster and crime boss Whitey Bulger. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg, with Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and James Badge Dale in supporting roles.\n","The film takes place in Boston and the surrounding metro area, primarily in the South Boston neighborhood. Irish Mob boss Frank Costello (Nicholson) plants Colin Sullivan (Damon) as a spy within the Massachusetts State Police; simultaneously, the police assign undercover state trooper Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's mob crew. When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each attempt to discover the other's identity before they are found out.\n","The Departed was a critical and commercial success, receiving acclaim for its direction, performances (particularly of DiCaprio, Nicholson, and Wahlberg), screenplay, and editing.\n","It won several accolades, including four Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards: for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. It remains Scorsese's only personal Oscar win. The film also received six nominations each at the 64th Golden Globe Awards and the 60th British Academy Film Awards, and two nominations at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Oppenheimer (film)\n","Summary: Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film written, directed and co-produced by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who directed the Manhattan Project, the project to develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, and his fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n","Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan's screenplay. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\n","Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film grossed over $962 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film. Widely regarded as one of the best films of 2023, the film received acclaim for its direction and screenplay, ensemble cast, t\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I have found out that the film Departed was released in the year 2006.

There are many distinctive strate-\\ngies for climate estimate and weather forecasting. But rainfall prediction is rare.\\nSome of the research has shown some classiﬁcation method to predict whether\\nit would be rain tomorrow or not. But instead of a classiﬁcation method for pre-\\ndicting rain, we need to the quantity of the rainfall in a particular place. There\\nis numerous equipment implement for foreseeing rainfall by utilizing the climate\\nconditions like temperature, humidity, weight. These conventional strategies can-\\nnot work productively so by utilizing machine learning procedures. we can create\\nan exact comes about rain forecast. Ready to fair do it by having the histori-\\ncal information investigation of rainfall and can anticipate the precipitation for\\nfuture seasons. In our paper, we presented some predictive regression analysis\\ntechniques to quantify rainfall quantity at a place. Here we used more than 10\\nyears of historical data to train our model. The dataset contains various weather\\nconditions of diﬀerent places. This method can be utilized to predict the rainfall\\n(The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm) and avoid the annihilation\\ncaused by it to life, agriculture, farm, and property. If we can quantify the rain-\\nfall most people can make some decisions before overwhelmed rain-aﬀected.

Data Pre-Processing\\nIn our dataset, there are parcels of unused, null, and duplicate values. For\\nthis reason, we took some steps to handle these issues. such as,\\n–Erased duplicate row and column: we discover that numerous information\\npoints are repeated in row and column sections. Therefore, we expelled all\\nthe duplicate information.\\n–Erased the row and column, which shows up more than 50% of the null value.\\nCleaning data occurs when 50% of information comes to the null value.

Thus, this issue must be unraveled before model-\\ning. In some cases, median, mean, mode strategies are utilized to overhaul\\na missing value. In any case, the foremost direct method for managing the\\nmissing value is the mean, median, mode strategy. Here we have utilized this\\nmean, median & mode strategy for managing missing data\\n–Handled categorical features: Categorical data could be a subjective include\\nwhose values are taken on the value of labels.

In our dataset, there exist a few categorical\\nfeatures. We have utilized one-hot encoding, one of the foremost prevalent\\nencoding algorithms, to encode the categorical values into numbers. It is the\\nforemost common approach, and it works well unless any categorical variable\\ntakes a large number of diverse values. After this encoding, a double matrix\\nis shaped where 1 indicates the presence of any value and 0 indicates the\\nabsence of the value.\\n–Inside our dataset, there were a lot of outliers presented: an outlier is a\\nperception point that’s removed from other perceptions. An outlier may be\\ndue to variations within the estimation or it may appear exploratory mistake\\nthe latter are some of the time excluded from the set of information.

Bulk orders will thrust\\nthrough littler convenience changes in a way that your average visitor may\\nnot.

In the data collection phase, we adopted real\\ndata from Australia from the Kaggle platform. The primary purpose of this\\ntask is to ﬁnd out the best regression technique for the prediction of rain. For\\nthis reason, we have used a variety of regression analysis techniques that can\\nbe utilized for predicting the quantity of rainfall so that anyone can use the\\nbest predictive model in real-life applications. To perform this task, we selected\\nﬁve signiﬁcant steps, these are data collection, data prepossessing, training model\\nusing regression analysis techniques, and performance analysis. In pre-processing\\npart, we have described cleaning data, Missing value check, EDA, Handling\\noutliers, Feature selection, Feature scaling respectively. Besides, we used ten\\nsupervised regressors (machine learning models) for predicting rainfall. Among\\nall models the are gives good accuracy in our predicting regression.
